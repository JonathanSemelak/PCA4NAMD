# PCA4NAMD
A bunch of python scripts to perform PCA-like methods on non adiabatic molecular dynamics data.

Briefly:

- Output_Analysers folder: Contains scripts to extract the data of interest from NAMD outpus run with AMBER-LIO (https://github.com/MALBECC/lio).
- correlation.py: Performs the PCA-like analysis using the files generated by the previous scripts as inputs.
