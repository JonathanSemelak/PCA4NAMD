This data set was filtered using:
minweight=0.7
temperature=300
alpha=100

To analyse them with KRR make sure to set in main.py:

Analysis_type='Coordinates-KRR'
dofiltered=False #because we want to use the already filtered files  

Parameters that have to be specified and some suggestions:

testsize=0.33
kernelalpha=0.001
kernelgama=1
search_best_params=False #if set to true, kernelalpha and kernelgama will be optimized (it will take some minutes though)
maxsamplesize=20000 #otherwise the array allocated by KRR is too large and does not fit in the RAM mem

Finally, just run:

python ../main.py
